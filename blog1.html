                <h3 class="blogcontentclass">By the time April arrives, spring is in full bloom in most parts of the
                    country. The birthday flower
                    for
                    April is the cheerful, colorful daisy. Daisies symbolize childhood innocence, simplicity and joy,
                    which
                    makes them a wonderful choice to give in a spring bouquet or to grow in your garden.

                    Daises are close cousins to sunflowers and the three most popular varieties are the Shasta daisy,
                    African
                    daisy and gerbera daisy. Shastas have snowy white petals with bright yellow centers and make great
                    cut
                    flowers. African daisies grow closer to the ground and have white, orange, yellow or apricot
                    flowers.

                    Gerbera daisies (or gerberas) are the most popular daisies and their large blooms can be found in a
                    rainbow
                    of bright colors, including pink, white, yellow, orange, cream, red and violet. The center of the
                    flower
                    can
                    be almost any color and often a single flower will have petals of many different colors.

                    Daisies in History

                    The gerbera daisy (gerbera jamesonii ) was discovered in 1884 near Barberton, South Africa, by
                    Scotsman
                    Robert Jameson. Breeding programs that began in England in 1890 perfected the flower’s quality and
                    colors,
                    making them a favorite among both gardeners and givers of bouquets. The gerbera is still the fifth
                    most
                    popular flower in the world behind the rose, carnation, chrysanthemum, and tulip.

                    It is believed that the name “daisy” is a variation of “day’s eye” because the whole flower head
                    closes
                    up
                    at night and opens up again in the morning light.

                    Colors and Symbolism

                    There are many meanings assigned to the gentle daisy—from innocence, simplicity and joy to
                    happiness,
                    good
                    luck and new beginnings. In Victorian times, daisies stood for loyalty and trust. There is also a
                    story
                    in
                    Roman mythology of a nymph named Belides who transformed herself into a daisy to escape unwanted
                    attention
                    from one of the gods. This story gives daisies the added meanings of modesty and innocence.</h3>
